      <p>
        To fulfill BCN's need for water we take water from the harbor and then filter it to produce
        clean water. This water isn't considered drinkable because of the need for regular testing
        to filter out any contaminants that might be inside of the harbor water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making water is an energy intensive process because the filters used have to be fine enough
        to filter even the tiniest particles. To push the water through those filters a high
        pressure pump is used, which requires a lot of energy to run.
