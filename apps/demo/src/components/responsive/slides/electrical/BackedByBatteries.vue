        To migitate the sun's tendency to hide away on the earth's other side we have to store the
        electricity we collect during the day so we can use it during the night. We have 218 kWhs of
        storage available to do this. That's enough to power a household for a whole month.
      </p>

      <p>
        218 kWh of energy is rouhgly equivalent to charging a smartphone 22000 times. We need that
        capacity to cover the energy consumption during the night.
